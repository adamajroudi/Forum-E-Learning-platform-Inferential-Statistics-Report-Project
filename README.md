# Forum-E-Learning-platform-Inferential-Statistics-Report-Project

Forum is an active online learning platform that emphasise the engagement aspect between
students and the material being taught through features such as reactions, polls, hand raises,
chat messages and many more in a seamless experience. This report examines the
engagement of Minerva students with cornerstone courses through the relation between
functionalities of polls and reactions based on a dataset of metrics collected automatically by
Forum. The research question is: Are there more reactions when there are more polls? I want to
explore this inquiry because polls might be graded so it forces students to focus, which can
drive them to be more engaged with the class. The population that I am trying to make
inferences about is every cornerstone session of the academic year 2022-2023 of all levels. I
have found that there is some correlation between the two variables, however I will use the
difference of means, effect size and confidence interval to seek the statistical significance of
my alternative hypothesis which states that the mean of reactions is higher in the group with
more polls than the group with less polls.
