Minerva is a leading innovative university that tackles education with a comprehensive approach
worthy of the 21st century. The curriculum utilizes the technology of our modern era to facilitate
learning by providing digital features such as a cross-class chat. Since all class sessions are
recorded, multiple metrics, such as the professor's talk time percentage and the number of chat
messages, are provided for analysis, feedback, and improvement. The research question for this
report asks if there is a correlation between the number of chat messages and the percentage of
instructors' talk time. The population that I will make an inference about is the freshman Minerva
cohort of 2022-2023. The purpose of the following analysis is to grasp the effects of technological
features on learning in the 21st century to innovate them and improve the digital classroom
